With more than 20 years of experience in embedded firmware development in different CPUs, different tools, and different interfaces. I think I am the right guy you are looking for for your project. I wish you may call me to discuss the details on my cellphone or using skype (nats1945).

best regards,
Nathaniel Fernandez

I don't have a direct experience with the problem like loading and speed optimization, what i can support is read the specs related to loading and optimization before i can recommend. what I did so far in OpenWrt is to modify the source code and configuration and update the Uci.
