Are you familiar with OpenWRT?

Please find below my requirement
- C programming on Linux environment (It will be run on Linux platform)
- The first part of the application would be parsing JSON data using libcjson 
and store it using uci using libuci
 (https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/tree/openwrt-18.06/package/system/uci), 
we are using uci to store our configuration so.
- Write auto build process to build it for cross platform using autotools and Makefile
Let me know if you have any further question?

I have more than 20 years experience in firmware/software development using c/c++ and assembly language using windows/linux OS. I also have OpenWRT exposure and currently using it for router in india. I hope you can give me a call to discuss in details your requirements or specs. best regards
