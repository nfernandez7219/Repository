hi sandip,
good evening.
i have a question.

based on my readings[1], a uic config only uses a tuple. that is, it is
arranged like so:
[subsystem].[section].[option]=value

[1] https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/intro-to-uci.html

but based on how your JSON1.txt one is arranged, the uci configuration will
have a maximum of up
to 6 sections like the one below:

root.wlan_group[0].wlan[0].GuestAccessList[0].whitelistUrl[0].createdBy=Admin

I am not sure how to proceed with this. could you give guidance on how to
proceed with this?

thanks.

hi sandip, i think i have completed the task. where can i give it to you. maybe you can get it to my private git repository but i am going out of the house to process something, i will be back by 9pm phil time

 3:24 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Hi Matthew, Good to know that. good progress, No problem, Just give me the access to that repository so I can pull it and test.

Today
 4:36 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
hi sandip, you may get the copy from here https://github.com/nfernandez7219/json-app.git

 
here are a few instruction to get you up to speed with the codebase.

 4:41 PM
1) initialize the autotools environment by running the autogen.sh "./autogen.sh"
2) initialize the make system by running ./configure
3) you can now type make to build the jsonapp.
4) the binary is located at the src/ directory.
5) sample json input files are located in test/ directory.
6) the jsonapp accepts the path to the input json file as parameter. so for example, if you want to test out test/wireless.json just type ./src/jsonapp test/wireless.json

7) you can verify changes/updates made by the jsonapp by running $ uci show wireless
8) you can also edit test/wireless.json (or any other sample json file inside the test/ directory)
9) you might need to run it as root since libuci accesses /etc/config which is usually not readable/writable to normal users.

found everything but some issue

 8:08 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
there is a sample json file under test folder, you have to use that

 
like this command. $ sudo .src/jsonapp test/wireless.json

 
this will be autmatically parse the json file under test/wireless folder and create a uci file under etc/config then save it using uci_commit. you will see this in the code

 8:10 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Ok let me try

 
But the format is different

 
in a test folder the JSON format is different

 
we want to parse it from JSON1.txt

 8:11 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
this is the anticipation format based on json

 
after the parsing it will product uci config format

 
*produce

 
before uci_commit

 
what you gave me the other time is the uci config format already so there is no to be parsed

 8:13 PM
Sandip Sitapara
So you generate the wireless.json from the JSON1.text

 8:13 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
yes

 
your wireless.txt is already uci config format

 
ready to be commit to uci

 8:14 PM
Sandip Sitapara
yes but when I run the jsonapp

 
it should read from json1.txt

 
and add it to your another intermideate file

 
but that test/wireless.json is different

 8:14 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
my task would be to parse json file the commit to uci

 8:15 PM
Sandip Sitapara
yes

 8:15 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
test/wireless.json is supposed to be json file

 8:15 PM
Sandip Sitapara
but the JSON I gave you

 
not the JSON you prepare

 8:15 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
we need to parse this file to become uci config format then save to uci

 
you gave me a uci config format not json format

 
we cannot parse from your json file if you say that so

 8:16 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Ok great

 8:16 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
try use the sample json file under test folder

 
and run the program

 8:16 PM
Sandip Sitapara
I don't want that

 8:16 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
you dont want the json file i have created

 
you want me to use your file?

 8:17 PM
Sandip Sitapara
no

 
I want to parse it from I gave you

 
This one

 JSON1.txt 17.41 kB 
 8:17 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
what parsing do you want

 
it is already ready to be commit to uci

 
your file is already compliant with the standard of uci

 8:18 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Tell me how you get the data from JSON1.txt?

 8:18 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
we just need to type uci_commit

 
then it will be saved to uci

 8:18 PM
Sandip Sitapara
no I don't want that

 8:19 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
can i ask what do you want?

 8:19 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Parse the data from JSON1.txt and apply the wlan section to wireless uci and radius section to hotspot

 8:20 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
ok

 
i will change the program if that is what you want

 8:20 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Actually, that is the data coming from our server so want to parse that and apply it to uci

 
please

 8:20 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
ok, no problem

 8:20 PM
Sandip Sitapara
We are not using any intermediate file

 8:21 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
ok

 
i will inform you the update not later tomorrow afternoon

 8:22 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Thanks Matthew, did you get my requirement or still you're confuse because again it should double work if don't

 8:22 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
i get it now

 8:22 PM
Sandip Sitapara
Ok Thanks

 8:22 PM
Matthew Nathan Fernandez
ok

 8:22 PM
Sandip Sitapara
