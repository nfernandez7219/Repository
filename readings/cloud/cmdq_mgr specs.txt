        number of qp number of wqe 
	wqe[8]
	freelist of wqe
		qp[8]	queue controller, segregate
		qp[0] --> need one freelist for wqe		capable of containing multiple queue request
		qp[1] --> need one freelist for wqe
		qp[2] --> need one freelist for wqe
		qp[7] --> need one freelist for wqe
	freelist
		wqe max 256 insert it into freelist	- available ready to use queue
every cmd needs to insert to qp head

pcbs - one element, initially this all the pcbs are inside ready to use (freelist)
when the work request comes in we will borrow one pcb
based from the qp of the work request, that pcb will be inserted to the qp
once that pcb is done, already performed the task it need to do, then it will return to the return

there is another command like congestion manager, the congestion manager can tell the device to stop all the process (pcb) that 
belongs to that qp
process control manager will not perform task from the qp

this is the reason why we segregate the pcb in every qp, so that the pm know what pcb can be performed

another queue mgr
pcb has can have 2 node, 1st node tells which it belong
the 2nd node tells its position to be processed

trying to line up, using stop light like red, green, yellow

dma - wait for the callback, thats the reason why we need 

based from the pcb there is func pointer to know which process is need to continue
