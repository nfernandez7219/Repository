1. kernel source code for OPTISAT    2. sw documentation    3. optisat manual
4. optisat s2/s receiver           5. currently using 2.64

1. short term need is to make optisat worked in 1 of 2 satellite input board
2. 2 version w/c is differ by compile settings
   1. focused at tv services reception and multiplexing
   2. address to satallite internet

task is to make satellite internet version workable
1. while TBSD satellite board is using S2API module requires min kernel 
   version 3.10. S2API contains dvb_net.c which performs MPE decapsulation
 
   MPE decapsulation is taking IP packets out of incoming MPEG TS stream (satellite stream)

   output of MPE decapsulation are IP packet which are entering TCP/IP stack

   TBSD has open source driver:   https://github.com/tbsdtv/linux_media/wiki
   we used this board   https://www.tbsdtv.com/products/tbs6902-dvb-s2-dual-tuner-pcie-card.html

   please analyze what is needed to be make in this solution to make it working

2. dektec board can work with current old kernel. it has proprietary driver.
   (we are distributor of dektec so can communicate directly)

   we use this satellite board  https://www.dektec.com/products/PCIe/DTA-2137C/

   so our first attempt is to make dektec board working, maybe there is just a small
   part missing namely dvb_net.c is not currently able to read data from dektec board.

   solutions is either to enable dektec board as one of inputs to dvb+net.c or extract
   MPE decapsulation part of code and apply to dektec output - which is MPEG TS packets

   MPEG TS packet are 188 bytes long packets with 4 byte header described in ISO 13818
   standard (we can send you some version)

   MPE decapsulation is implemented in dvb_net.c so this is first candidate of inspection

   dvb_net_drv seems to be causing problems as it is not initializing dektec board and it
   crashes.

     please analyze what is need to be made in this solution to make it working
     tesing can be done at our side by this setup

   IP Encalsulation>Modulator>OPTISAT[L band coax cable]

   we can provide remote access to 2 different HW setup:
   1. OPTISAT with TBSD receiver, kernel 5.10 driver installed
   2. OPTISAT with dektec receiver, kernel 2.64

   first task is basically to verify your work, if you prove to be productive
   we can move to longer term project
   first job is to make some modification in kernel code, keeping old 2.64 kernel
   first approach will be to adopt source under old kernel without porting,  later we may port it look more complex task
