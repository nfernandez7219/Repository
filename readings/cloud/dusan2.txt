digital tv linux, partially in kernel mostly in user space
2 parts to be developed in linux
 transmit csg
 receive dsa

for dsa key functionality is timestamping of arriving digital packets by 
 gps timestamps - epoch and then multiplex them deteministically

they have digital tv solution written in kernel, erlang, javascript
where it would be good to fit in

they can provide with book explaining ditital tv standard and technologies  

entire working configuration is like this:
source of traffic via lan (ip packets) > i[ encapsulator [mpeg ts] 
 > modulator [L band] > optisat s2 receiver > lan (ip packets)

i will give you later my ssh key,
can i ask something for clarification?
right now, we are studying how this project is going to work, base on analysis, we are going to concentrate on dektec board.
1. can i ask for the system or block diagram so we can visualize how the system is working
2. based from your attempt i think the error is during your registration of your driver the the linux system, and the initialization maybe is the cause of crashing.
3. with your experience, we go back to the basic of checking the dvb
    how to properly register it.
4. we downloaded the dektec linux sdk DekTec Drivers and SDKs to see how to properly use the dektec
5. in your previous email you said that you can give this  (MPEG TS packet are 188 bytes long packets with 4 byte header described in ISO 13818
   standard (we can send you some version)
6. we believe that we can do it, i will just keep you updated

Here are short notes of what we discussed to follow

Steps:

1) Technical Understanding of solution - google drive + explanations, Redmine account

2) 2-3 full time programmers for 9 months

3) Understanding Technical requirements (real-time processing) GPS PCIe receiver
    Existing source code Framework C/C++, Erlang, Javascript
4) Analysis
    Decide what programming languages to use, Erlang, C#, Rast etc.
    enhance existing code or write from scratch (if so which modules)
    
4) Price to be agreed

We can contract directly  - so you will avoid 20% Upwork provision and It will be long term.
We need find a mutually acceptable price to cooperate.

I suggest 12 Eur/hour what equals to 14,4 Eur/hour via Upworks.

With 22 working days x 8 hours = 176 hours x 12 = 2112 Eur/month
