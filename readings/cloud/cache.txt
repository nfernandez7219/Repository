a. increase the number sets by 1/2.
d. high associative cache will have lower miss rate, 
so its faster
g. lower miss rate due to high associativity
j. sets will be associated to more blocks 

b. also high associative by 1/2
e. high number of sets will have lower miss rate,
so its faster
h. high number of sets will hae lower miss rate, faster
k. sets will be associated to more blocks, so its faster

c. word offset will decrease
f. performance will decrease because the association will only get half due block size
i. higher number of misses due to half block size being fetch from the main memory
l. higher misses due to lower block size, map to the same cache location is 
the same
