optimux

advanced sfn streams processing
enabling significant opex & capex savings

parallel direct to tower & dth
regional advertisements
emergency warning system
regional tv programs
contribution link re-use
local tv insertion

sfn limits:
sfn networks need identical transport streams for sfn transmitters
when it comes to the content modification needs, such as regionalization,
 parallel dtt & dth transmission, regional content insertion, this causes
 a steep increase of distribution bandwidth as they need to transmit multiple
 and modified transport streams
this significantly impacts the flexibility to modify and regionalize sfn signals

optimux allows to support regionalization by keeping opex costs at minimal
 level eliminating multiplication of required bandwidth

modules:
1 optimux dth - parallel dtt & dth transmission
2 optimux ad - reginal advertisement insertion into national TVs
3 optimux ews - emergency warning system
4 optimux reg - regional tv programs
5 optimux local - re-multiplexing local tv program
6 optimux contri - reusing contribution link capacity

optimux dth dvb-t2 configuration
optimux platform consists of:
1. optimux-t2 tx adapter located at satellite uplink
2. optimux-t2 rx adapter places at tv transmitters

dth receivers do not need any modification to receive signal
