MPEG transport stream
 is a standard digital container format for transmission and storage of audio
 video, and program and system information protocol (PSIP) data. it is used
 in broadcast systems such as dvb, atsc, and iptv

 transport stream specifies a container format encapsulating packetized 
 elementary streams, with error correction and synchronization pattern features
 for maintaining transmission integrity when the communication channel carrying
 the stream is degraded
 
 transport streams differ from the similarly-named MPEG program stream in
 several important ways: program streams are designed for reasonably reliable
 media, such as discs (like DVDs)
