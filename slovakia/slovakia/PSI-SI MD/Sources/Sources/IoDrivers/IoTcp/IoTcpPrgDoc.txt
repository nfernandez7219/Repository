IoTcp is a Dll realizing simulated i/o using tcp. This dll is used both by
Server/Receiver programs for test purposes.
Rules for connect string specification are explained in Server/Receiver online readme files.

Application interface is concentrated into following objects:
 - tcp_driver_ioctl() implementing standard i/o dll interface as described
   in Dvblib\h\DrvInterface.hpp.
 - communication classes ComInpTcp (Receiver) and ComOutTcp (Server) implementing
   DvbLib classes BaseInpDriver, resp. ComOut; both are described in DvbLib\h\ComIo.hpp.

Single exported function (tcp_driver_ioctl()) is implemented in drv_tcp.cpp
and declared in the def file.

As user id disk id is used.
IoTcp.dll does not implement either interactive setup or statistics.
