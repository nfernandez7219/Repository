IoComergon is an intermediate Dll connecting Application (Server/Receiver programs)
and NT Comergon Card driver md_DvbDriver.sys.

md_DvbDriver.sys takes care about the data exchange with the Card. The same driver
works for both Server and Receiver applications.
Sources for md_DvbDriver.sys are located under dvbDirectory\drivers\CardNT.
Readme file in the same directory describes the build process.

Application interface is concentrated into following objects:
 - Comergon_driver_ioctl() implementing standard i/o dll interface as described
   in Dvblib\h\DrvInterface.hpp.
 - communication classes ComInpDVB (Receiver) and ComOutDVB (Server) implementing
   DvbLib classes BaseInpDriver, resp. ComOut; both are described in DvbLib\h\ComIo.hpp.

Single exported function (Comergon_driver_ioctl()) is implemented in drv_ComDvb.cpp
and declared in the def file.

Source files:
 card.cpp
	Low level interface to md_DvbDriver.sys (corresp. header is card.h)
 ComDvb.cpp
	Implements:
	- communication classes ComInpDVB (Receiver) and ComOutDVB (Server),
	- ComergonErrorAsText(): function translating error codes into textual form,
	- openDVB() and closeDVB() functions (handshake procedure with the card).
 ComDvbRegistry.cpp
	Utilities working with Registry settings.
 ComDvbSetup.cpp
	Implements DvbSetupDialog() - instead of MFC API functions are used.
 ComDvbStatistics.cpp
	Implements:
	- ComDVBSetup class (configuration storage),
	- StatPageBaseDVB class - sheet dialog page displaying card statistics,
	- statistics-related functions of ComInpDVB class,
	- function readDrvStatistics()
 ComInstall.cpp
	Implements installDialog() - function used from Install Shield to install the card.
 drv_ComDvb.cpp
	Implements Comergon_driver_ioctl() - single dll entry point.
